# MorphGUI: Real-time GUIs Customization with Large Language Models

MorphGUI is a framework that leverages Large Language Models to enable users to customize interfaces using natural language without altering the application's core functionalities. Its structured dual-input design separates functional goals ("what it should do") from visual specifications ("how it should appear"), allowing users to modify interface elements while maintaining the integrity of the underlying system logic. Powered by a dynamic component architecture, MorphGUI applies updates at runtime, preserving both the application state and baseline functionality.

## Customization Interface

The "Enhance With AI" panel in MorphGUI enables users to personalize and modify their interface through AI-assisted customization. It features two main sections, **Static Settings** and **Dynamic Settings**, allowing configuration of both fixed and adaptive interface components. 

Within the **Dynamic Settings** tab, the **Personalize** section introduces component-level targeting for modifying or adding UI elements. Users specify:
- **What it should do**: to define the element's functional behavior.
- **How it should appear**: to control its styling and layout.

The panel also provides three main actions:
- **Generate**: to apply the defined changes.
- **Previous**: to roll back to a previous configuration.
- **Restore**: to return the interface to its last stable state.
